## **Installation**

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ssj317/chatterbox.git
cd chatterbox

2. Install dependencies:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm install
3. Start the server:
bash
Copy
Edit
npm start
The server will listen on port 3000, and you can access the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

How it Works
Server:
The server listens on port 3000 and serves the chat page.
It uses Socket.IO to handle real-time connections and emits the total number of connected clients to all clients.
When a user sends a message, it is broadcast to all connected clients in real-time.
Signup/Signin/Logout functionality is handled via POST requests:
/auth/signup for registering new users.
/auth/login for logging in.
/auth/logout for logging out.

Client:
The frontend is built using basic HTML and CSS.
The name-input field shows the username (which can be pre-set).
When the user submits a message, itâ€™s sent via Socket.IO and displayed on all clientsâ€™ screens.
The client also listens for "typing" feedback to show when someone is typing a message.
On the homepage, the username of the logged-in user is displayed.

Authentication (Signup/Signin/Logout)
Signup:
Users can sign up by providing a username and password.
The password is hashed and stored securely in the database using bcrypt.

Signin:
Existing users can log in using their username and password.
The password is verified using bcrypt.

Logout:
Users can log out, which clears their session.

Usage
Connect: When a user visits the app, they will be assigned a username (default is "Anonymous").
Send Messages: Type a message in the input field and hit "Send".
See Real-Time Updates: As messages are sent, they will appear immediately on the screen for all users.
Check Client Count: The total number of connected clients will be displayed at the bottom.
View Username: The username of the logged-in user is shown on the homepage.
